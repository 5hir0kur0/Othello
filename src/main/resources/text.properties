game_rules_html=<html><body> <p>Othello is played on an board with 8×8 fields.</p> <p>At the beginning there are two white and two black disks in the middle fields of the board so that the same-colored disks form diagonals.</p> <p>The number of disks per player is unlimited.</p> <p>Players take alternate turns. You can either place a disk on an empty field or skip (pass).</p> <p>After placing a dark disk, dark turns over (flips to dark, captures) the single disk (or chain of light disks) on the line between the new piece and an anchoring dark piece. No player can look back to the previous status of disks when playing moves. A valid move is one where at least one piece is reversed (flipped over).</p> <p>If one player can not make a valid move, play passes back to the other player. When neither player can move, the game ends.</p> <p>The player with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game wins. If both players have the same number of disks at the end, the game ends in a tie.</p> <p>(Adapted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi</a>)</p> </body></html>
